This script is intended to be used on Arch Linux; there are likely alternative package names for other distros. As of this writing you will need: groot, debootstrap (creates Debian chroots), mkchroot (creates Arch chroots)

On the Arch chroots; my package manager wrapper frost is also installed. If you want to use this you will need to setup it's dependencies (yaourt or yay depending on version you use).
